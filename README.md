First task
## **Salim Hassouneh**
I hold a BSc in civil engineering from *ASU* , I'm passionate about programming , and i have studied some as a hobby. I hope to be able to shift carrer after the ASAC course.

To be a good ***Programmer*** , First of all, you should understand the purpose of the software, then it should be simple and easy to understand. as well as the quality of the code over rushing a code. a programmer should always think about the problem and try to break tasks into managable subtasks. and should remember that good enough is fine .
